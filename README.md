EduBridge: Opening Doors to Education for All" EduBridge is more than just an app; it's a lifeline for children in need. Designed for families of migratory laborers, daily wage workers, and underserved communities, EduBridge connects them to nearby government schools, NGOs, and learning centers offering free education and skill development.

With features like GPS-based school discovery, one-tap contact, and multilingual support, we ensure that no child is left behind. Whether it's enrolling in a school, finding vocational training, or accessing free learning resources, EduBridge is here to make education accessible, inclusive, and transformative.
